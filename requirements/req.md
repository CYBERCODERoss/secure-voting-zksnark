## User Stories

1. **As an eligible voter, I want to authenticate anonymously so my identity remains confidential while I participate in voting.**
2. **As a system administrator, I need an effectively secure system to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure legitimate votes.**
3. **As a user, I expect the system to provide clear confirmation of my activities to ensure my vote is counted without revealing my identity.**

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Anonymous Voter Authentication
- **Actor**: Voter
- **Goal**: Authenticate securely without revealing personal identity.
- **Preconditions**: Voter has received a unique identifier during registration.
- **Main Flow**:
   1. Voter presents his/her unique identifier through the UI.
   2. System computes a zk-SNARK proof using the identifier.
   3. System verifies the proof.
   4. Upon successful verification, access to vote is granted.
- **Postconditions**: Voter remains anonymous but is authenticated to vote.
- **Exception Paths**: If verification fails, access is denied.

### Use Case 2: System Administration
- **Actor**: System Administrator
- **Goal**: Oversee and manage system operations.
- **Preconditions**: Admin credentials are verified.
- **Main Flow**:
   1. Admin logs into the system management dashboard.
   2. Admin reviews system logs and real-time data.
- **Postconditions**: Administrator is able to monitor and manage the voting process.
- **Exception Paths**: None.

## UI/UX Design

### Key Pages
- **Login Page**:
  - Minimal input fields for entering anonymous credentials.
  - Submission button for proof.
- **Voting Interface**:
  - Indicators for voting status.
  - Simple, intuitive layout for choosing options and submitting votes.

## Backend Functionalities

### Core Components
- **zk-SNARKs Generator**: Generates zero-knowledge proofs from user identifiers.
- **Proof Verifier**: Validates the proofs without needing blockchain.
- **Database Management**: Handles data storage securely without revealing voter identity.

### Technology Stack
- **Server**: Python Flask or Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Zk-SNARKs Libraries**: Libsnark, Bellman
- **Additional**: Secure API endpoints, encryption at rest and in transit.

## Cryptographic Requirements

### zk-SNARKs Integration
- **Circuit Definition**: Define the computation logic for the zk-SNARK to ensure it matches the confidentiality requirements.
- **Parameter Setup**: Structured with a trusted setup if not utilizing a universal and updatable setup.
- **Proof and Verification Mechanisms**: Ensure that proofs are generated and verified securely on the server side.

### Security Measures
- **Data Protection**: Use encryption techniques to protect data at rest and during transit.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs of operations in a secure manner for accountability and auditing, without compromising voter anonymity.
